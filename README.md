# PLP-1 Lanuage Overview and Setup

The name of the language I will be researching for my Programming Language Project (PLP) is C++


The C++ language was created in 1979 by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Laboratories. Stroustrup created C++ as an extension of the C language in order to have a more efficient and flexible language that was close to C, which also provided the same if not higher-level features for program organization.


C++ is a versatile language used for multiple purposes and is applied to projects that might be deemed unexpected. 
C++ supports Operating Systems from MacOS and Windows to mobile operating systems like iOS to be fast and efficient at managing system resources. 
C++ also supports large software infrastructure and applications that run on limited resources which help to develop desktop applications, productivity tools, and business applications.
C++ is one of the most widely-used programming languages in game development was used to create games like World of Warcraft and StarCraft as well as gaming consoles like Xbox, PlayStation, and Nintendo Switch.


The following resources will support me as I start programming in C++:

To program in C++ you first need to download an integrated development enviornment(IDE). I personally use Visual Studio Code for my CS classes and will use it to program in C++.

Visual Studio is the recommended C++ programming environment.
 
To run programs in C++ you can hit the run button in the top corner of the Visual Studio display, or go to the top of your laptop screen and hit run --> run without debugging

To write comments in C++ you use two forward slashes
   //like this
