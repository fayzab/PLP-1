The name of my language is C++

C++ was created in 1979 by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Laboratories. Stroustrup created C++ as an extension of the C language in order to have a more efficient and flexible language that was close to C which also provided the same if not higher-level features for program organization.

C++ is used in operating systems, for developing browsers and applications, in-game programming, software engineering, and data structures.


I will use the following sources when I start programming in C++:

I needed Visual Studio Code to install the language.

C++ come with a recommended the Visual Studio by Microsoft programming environment.
